Website Development
Develop a website of your choice. You can decide the contents of the website. You can also chose to copy a scaled down version of some popular website.

It must have users, and data to be saved in database.

You will also have to submit scripts that populate your website.

There will be a master script that will carry out entire setup.

Detailed submission instructions will be posted later.
