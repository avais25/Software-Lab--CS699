Pyplot and Latex
Make a report on the previous data assignment in latex. You can chose any other topic also if you wish.

The report can be in single column or two column format and should include:

1) Include your roll number in the author
2) Include sections, subsections, paragraphs
3)  Use different fonts styles and sizes and formatting.
4) Various styles of bullet points ex. itemize, enumerate, etc.
5) Include at least four chart/plot figures generated with pyplot. Each plot should have  different style - line chart, bar chart, histogram etc. From python you will have to save figures.
6) Use float package for proper placing of the figures.  
7) Include at least three complex Mathematical equations of your choice.
8) Include at least one table - you should use python code to generate the table from a dataFrame. The code should write a tex file and your latex file should use '\input' to include that tex file.
9) Use caption for all figures and tables. Use labels for all sections, figures, and, tables. Refer to all figures, tables, and sections in your report using those labels.

Python code for 5) and 8) together will also need to be submitted in a different file.

Detailed submission instructions will be posted by TAs later.
