Data Analysis Assignment
Use the export-import data to answer the following questions. In all the questions use, 2011-12 data by default, unless the question needs data from both years.

Some hints are given but the answer may require much more work than the given hint.
1) Which are are our top five import and export destinations, by total imports and total exports?

2) Which are are our top five import and export commodities?

3) Prepare a single table that shows total imports, total exports, export/import ratio, export-import (trade deficit) for each country. (Hint: use pd.concat)
4) Use the 'query' method to show all countries to whom our export is more than Rs 10,000 Cr. You must use the 'query' method.

5) Save the answer to 4 in a new table. Rename the columns of this table to: 

'Country', 'Exports', 'Imports'

6) Using the table in 5, create a new table with column headings '
Country	Transaction	Value
Hint: use the 'melt' method.

From this table, list our top 10 transactions with various countries. These will be mix of imports and exports.



Country	Transaction	Value
0	U ARAB EMTS	Exports	1.722685e+12
1	U S A	Exports	1.664743e+12


Note: answering 5 or 6 may not be as straightforward as it may appear, depending on how you do it.



7) Make a table of commodities that we both export and import.
