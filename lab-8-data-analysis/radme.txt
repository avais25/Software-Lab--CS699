Description:-
The program takes Import and Export xls file as input and give output acoording to question in a output file.
In Q1 & Q2 it calculate top 5 country and commodity resoectively based on Value of 2011-2012
In Q3 I have used outer join to merge both table. If value of import is 0 for some country in outputs "Zero Import" in export/import cell. If some value of import or export is not available it outputs "NotAvailable" in that cell and its respective ratiio and defict cell.
In Q4 the 'query' method is used show all countries to whom our export is more than Rs 10,000 Cr.
In Q5 the output of Q4 is stored along with import and export
Format- "Country ,Import (INR),Export (INR)"
In Q6 melt function (id_vars=['Country'], value_vars=['Export','Import']) is used on output of Q5 
"Country,Transaction,Value (INR)"
In Q7 Inntersection of commodities of both Import and Export is taken.
